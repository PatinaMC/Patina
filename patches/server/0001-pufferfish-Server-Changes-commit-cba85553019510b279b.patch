Subject: [PATCH] pufferfish Server Changes commit
 cba85553019510b279be9be037128b4f892098b8

Pufferfish Utils

Pufferfish Config and Command

Add SIMD utilities

Add Sentry

Add option to disable books

Books are commonly the target of duping-related exploits. If you
anticipate that your server will be an early target of duping attacks in
the event that new exploits are found, you may want to consider removing
the ability for non-privileged players to edit books. This patch allows
you to easily disable books, should you want to preemptively remove this
functionality before additional exploits are found.

Optimize entity coordinate key

When executing getCoordinateKey for entities (a hotpath), the JVM is
required to repeatedly cast doubles to longs. The performance impact of
this depends on the CPU architecture, but generally switching between
FPU and ALU incurs a significant performance hit. The casted/rounded
data is already available in the blockPosition struct, so we use that
instead of re-doing the casting.

Optimize suffocation

The isInWall check to determine suffocation is quite expensive, and
often is completely unnecessary to check. We do two things here to
improve this:

1. We only check for suffocation once per 20 ticks. The maximum
no-damage ticks value means that this change should be extremely
difficult, if not impossible, for players to notice.

2. We additionally execute a check to see if the player can even take
damage in the first place. This check doesn't improve performance much
but is so much cheaper than the suffocation check that it's worth
keeping it.

Optimize mob spawning

This patch aims to reduce the main-thread impact of mob spawning by
offloading as much work as possible to other threads. It is possible for
inconsistencies to come up, but when they happen they never interfere
with the server's operation (they don't produce errors), and side
effects are limited to more or less mobs being spawned in any particular
tick.

It is possible to disable this optimization if it is not required or if
it interferes with any plugins. On servers with thousands of entities,
this can result in performance gains of up to 15%, which is significant
and, in my opinion, worth the low risk of minor mob-spawning-related
inconsistencies.

Disable Paper timings by default

Simpler ShapelessRecipes comparison for Vanilla

Paper added a fancy sorting comparison due to Bukkit recipes breaking
the vanilla one, however this is far more advanced than what you need
for all the vanilla recipes.

Move ThreadUnsafeRandom Initialization

ThreadUnsafeRandom is initialized too late and some of our patches
require it to be initialized earlier. By moving it to the superclass, we
initialize it earlier, ensuring that it is available sooner.

Optimize random calls in chunk ticking

Especially at over 30,000 chunks these random calls are fairly heavy. We
use a different method here for checking lightning, and for checking
ice.

Lightning: Each chunk now keeps an int of how many ticks until the
lightning should strike. This int is a random number from 0 to 100000 * 2,
the multiplication is required to keep the probability the same.

Ice and snow: We just generate a single random number 0-16 and increment
it, while checking if it's 0 for the current chunk.

Depending on configuration for things that tick in a chunk, this is a
5-10% improvement.

Dynamic Activation of Brain

This replaces the current method of ticking an inactive entity's
pathfinder 1/4 times with a new method that's dynamic based off how far
away it is from a player. If an entity is within 32 blocks, it gets
ticked every tick. If it's within 45 blocks, it gets ticked every other
tick. If it's within 55 blocks, it gets ticked once every three ticks.
(these numbers have since been changed, but the idea is the same.)

Remove iterators from inventory contains

Early return optimization for target finding

More debug for plugins not shutting down tasks

Improve fluid direction caching

Implements a custom cache that better fits the needs of fluids
calculating whether a direction can be moved in or something. There's a
big javadoc on the FluidDirectionCache with some more information.

Cache climbing check for activation

Config to disable method profiler

Make EntityCollisionContext a live representation

While Context is in the name, it is not used as a context. Instead it is
always created, use temporarily, then thrown away. This means having a
lot of fields to initialize and make space for is useless. I cannot find
anywhere in the codebase where this is used as a context which may be
saved for later, so this should be safe assuming plugins don't use it
for some strange reason.

Improve container checking with a bitset

Better checking for useless move packets

Use aging cache for biome temperatures

Use thread unsafe random for mob spawning

Remove streams and iterators from range check

Skip cloning loot parameters

Small improvement in CPU, much larger improvement in allocations. As a
new loot context is created every time a player moves (along with a lot
of other times) the constant cloning churns out a lot of useless
objects.

Fix Paper#6045, block goal shouldn't load chunks

Reduce entity allocations

Remove lambda from ticking guard

Reduce entity fluid lookups if no fluids

Throttle goal selector during inactive ticking

Entity TTL

Add option to disable out-of-order chat

Option to disable end crystal dragon respawning

On servers that expect end crystal fights in the end dimension,
disabling this will prevent the server from performing an expensive
search to attempt respawning the ender dragon whenever a player places
an end crystal.
