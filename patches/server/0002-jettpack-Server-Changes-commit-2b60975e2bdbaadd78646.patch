(Yatopia) New nbt cache

The goal of this patch is to reduce I/O operations from the main thread while saving player data and also to avoid too many I/O operations while reading NBT Player file by using a cache (Which start to delete the oldest data when there is too much player compared to the map size)

(PaperPR) Add Alternate Current redstone implementation

Co-authored by: Simon Gardling <titaniumtown@gmail.com>

Originally created by SpaceWalkerRS for the alternate-current (<https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current>) project and licensed under the MIT license.

This patch implements SpaceWalkerRS's optimized redstone algorithm as an alternative to Eigencraft and Vanilla's implementations. This patch also sets Eigencraft as the default redstone implementation

+/**
+ * This class handles power changes for redstone wire. The algorithm
+ * was designed with the following goals in mind:
+ * <br>
+ * 1. Minimize the number of times a wire checks its surroundings to
+ *    determine its power level.
+ * <br>
+ * 2. Minimize the number of block and shape updates emitted.
+ * <br>
+ * 3. Emit block and shape updates in a deterministic, non-locational
+ *    order, fixing bug MC-11193.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * In Vanilla redstone wire is laggy because it fails on points 1 and 2.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Redstone wire updates recursively and each wire calculates its power
+ * level in isolation rather than in the context of the network it is a
+ * part of. This means a wire in a grid can change its power level over
+ * half a dozen times before settling on its final value. This problem
+ * used to be worse in 1.14 and below, where a wire would only decrease
+ * its power level by 1 at a time.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * In addition to this, a wire emits 42 block updates and up to 22 shape
+ * updates each time it changes its power level.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Of those 42 block updates, 6 are to itself, which are thus not only
+ * redundant, but a big source of lag, since those cause the wire to
+ * unnecessarily re-calculate its power level. A block only has 24 
+ * neighbors within a Manhattan distance of 2, meaning 12 of the remaining
+ * 36 block updates are duplicates and thus also redundant.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Of the 22 shape updates, only 6 are strictly necessary. The other 16
+ * are sent to blocks diagonally above and below. These are necessary
+ * if a wire changes its connections, but not when it changes its power
+ * level.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Redstone wire in Vanilla also fails on point 3, though this is more of
+ * a quality-of-life issue than a lag issue. The recursive nature in which
+ * it updates, combined with the location-dependent order in which each
+ * wire updates its neighbors, makes the order in which neighbors of a
+ * wire network are updated incredibly inconsistent and seemingly random.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Alternate Current fixes each of these problems as follows.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * 1.
+ * To make sure a wire calculates its power level as little as possible,
+ * we remove the recursive nature in which redstone wire updates in
+ * Vanilla. Instead, we build a network of connected wires, find those
+ * wires that receive redstone power from "outside" the network, and
+ * spread the power from there. This has a few advantages:
+ * <br>
+ * - Each wire checks for power from non-wire components just once, and
+ *   from nearby wires just twice.
+ * <br>
+ * - Each wire only sets its power level in the world once. This is
+ *   important, because calls to World.setBlockState are even more
+ *   expensive than calls to World.getBlockState.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * 2.
+ * There are 2 obvious ways in which we can reduce the number of block
+ * and shape updates.
+ * <br>
+ * - Get rid of the 18 redundant block updates and 16 redundant shape
+ *   updates, so each wire only emits 24 block updates and 6 shape updates
+ *   whenever it changes its power level.
+ * <br>
+ * - Only emit block updates and shape updates once a wire reaches its
+ *   final power level, rather than at each intermediary stage. 
+ * <br>
+ * For an individual wire, these two optimizations are the best you can
+ * do, but for an entire grid, you can do better!
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * Since we calculate the power of the entire network, sending block and
+ * shape updates to the wires in it is redundant. Removing those updates
+ * can reduce the number of block and shape updates by up to 20%.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * 3.
+ * To make the order of block updates to neighbors of a network
+ * deterministic, the first thing we must do is to replace the location-
+ * dependent order in which a wire updates its neighbors. Instead, we
+ * base it on the direction of power flow. This part of the algorithm
+ * was heavily inspired by theosib's 'RedstoneWireTurbo', which you can
+ * read more about in theosib's comment on Mojira
+ * <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81098?focusedCommentId=420777&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-420777">here</a>
+ * or by checking out its implementation in carpet mod
+ * <a href="https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/src/main/java/carpet/helpers/RedstoneWireTurbo.java">here</a>.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * The idea is to determine the direction of power flow through a wire
+ * based on the power it receives from neighboring wires. For example, if
+ * the only power a wire receives is from a neighboring wire to its west,
+ * it can be said that the direction of power flow through the wire is east. 
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * We make the order of block updates to neighbors of a wire depend on what
+ * is determined to be the direction of power flow. This not only removes
+ * locationality entirely, it even removes directionality in a large
+ * number of cases. Unlike in 'RedstoneWireTurbo', however, I have decided
+ * to keep a directional element in ambiguous cases, rather than to 
+ * introduce randomness, though this is trivial to change.
+ * 
+ * <p>
+ * While this change fixes the block update order of individual wires,
+ * we must still address the overall block update order of a network. This
+ * turns out to be a simple fix, because of a change we made earlier: we
+ * search through the network for wires that receive power from outside it,
+ * and spread the power from there. If we make each wire transmit its power
+ * to neighboring wires in an order dependent on the direction of power
+ * flow, we end up with a non-locational and largely non-directional wire
+ * update order.
